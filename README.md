# Django Identity and Access Management

Roles and access management for django apps

## Quick Setup

```shell
pip install django-iam
```

Make sure you have a custom user model setup and in `settings.py` you have

```python
AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'users.User'  # Point to your custom user model
```

Add `iam` to your `INSTALLED_APPS`

```python
# settings.py
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    ...,  # django apps
    'iam',
    ...,  # Your apps
]

AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = [
    ...,
    'rules.permissions.ObjectPermissionBackend',
    'django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend',
    ...
]
```

Create a profile for the role, e.g.

```python
# app/models.py
from django.db import models
from iam.factories import AbstractProfileFactory
from iam.contrib.utils import get_profile_class_verbose_name_plural


class SomeRoleProfile(
    AbstractProfileFactory.as_abstract_model(related_name='blog_author_profile'),
    models.Model
):
    # user = models.OneToOneField(settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL, on_delete=models.PROTECT)  # comes from AbstractProfileFactory

    class Meta:
        # Adds a little ðŸ‘¤ emoji to the name in admin, to make it clear this is a profile model
        verbose_name_plural = get_profile_class_verbose_name_plural('BlogAdminProfile')
```

In your app, create a `rules.py`:

```python
# app/rules.py
import rules
from iam.utils import lazy_get_predicate

# refer to https://github.com/dfunckt/django-rules#permissions-in-the-admin for why this is here
rules.add_perm('some_app', rules.is_staff)

is_some_role = lazy_get_predicate('some_app.SomeRole')
```

In your model that you are planning to set access to:

```python
# app/models.py
from rules.contrib.models import RulesModel
from some_app.rules import is_some_role


class SomeModel(
    RulesModel
):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

    class Meta:
        rules_permissions = {
            'add': is_some_role,
            'view': is_some_role,
            'change': is_some_role,
            'delete': is_some_role,
        }
```

As the last step, enable your user model to work with IAM and roles by having it inherit `IAMUserMixin`:

```python
# users/models.py
from iam.mixins import IAMUserMixin


class User(
    IAMUserMixin,
    ...,
    AbstractUser
):
    ...
```

Now only users that have a `SomeRoleProfile` profile can access `SomeModel`.

## Development and Testing

### IDE Setup

Add the `example` directory to the `PYTHONPATH` in your IDE to avoid seeing import warnings in the `tests` modules. If
you are using PyCharm, this is already set up.

### Running the Tests

Install requirements

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For local environment

```
pytest
```

For all supported environments

```
tox
```
